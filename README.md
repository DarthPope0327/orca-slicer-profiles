If you add a printer as a voron all filament and print profiles can be used from these profiles.

Included are profiles for PLA, ABS/ASA, and PETG at various speeds for both standard Voron Part print settings and general 3d models as well as Clear PETG parts and ERCF printers and printers with aux cooling.

Please make sure to use profiles that are compatible with your printers limitations. Make sure you have max accels and speeds set in your printer.cfg to prevent damage to your printer.
